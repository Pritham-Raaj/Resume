* B.E. in Mechatronics Engineering - Rajalakshmi Engineering College(May 2022)

### Skills
* Proficiency in Python
* Skilled in Data Analysis and Processing
* Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Numpy.
* ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Transformers.
* Proficient in Data visualisation using Matplotlib, SHAP and Seaborn.
* Profcient in container tools like Docker.

### Projects
Classification Model using Sparse Neural Network
* Trained models like ResNet and VGG for image classification through implementation of Sparse Neural Network.
* To address accuracy deficiencies in Sparse training, masking and selective pruning as well as weight regrowth is implemented.
* Successfully optimized the original training performance of the Sparse models by 50% by applying weight sharing techniques.
* Produced a respectable result with an accuracy of 72%.

Song Recommendation Engine
* Led a team of 2 students, to create a song recommendation engine by implementing Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering concepts.
* Successfully deployed the recommendation system through flask applications and hosting it through Heroku.

Prediction Model for Health Care
* Trained models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNeighbors Classifier to predict heart disease in patients through medical data.
* Optimised the performance of the models through the implementation of Random Search Cross-Validation with an accuracy of 83%.
* Further analysis, representation and comparision of the models was done through SHAP.
